chr6	28477796	33448354	MHC	0	+	28477796	33448354	0,0,0	The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a set of genes that code for cell surface proteins essential for the acquired immune system to recognize foreign molecules in vertebrates, which in turn determines histocompatibility. The main function of MHC molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. The human MHC is also called the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) complex (often just the HLA).	region with many variants

chrX	60000	2699520	PAR1	0	+	60000	2699520	0,0,0	The pseudoautosomal regions, PAR1, PAR2 are homologous sequences of nucleotides on the X and Y chromosomes. They are hard-masked with Ns in some assembly sequence files, for example NCBI's analysis set of the genome and the files distributed by Ensembl. Wikipedia:(...) Normal male mammals have two copies of these genes: one in the pseudoautosomal region of their Y chromosome, the other in the corresponding portion of their X chromosome. Normal females also possess two copies of pseudoautosomal genes, as each of their two X chromosomes contains a pseudoautosomal region. Crossing over between the X and Y chromosomes is normally restricted to the pseudoautosomal regions; thus, pseudoautosomal genes exhibit an autosomal, rather than sex-linked, pattern of inheritance. So, females can inherit an allele originally present on the Y chromosome of their father. The function of these pseudoautosomal regions is that they allow the X and Y chromosomes to pair and properly segregate during meiosis in males.	chrX:60001-2699520

chr17	43384863	44913631	MAPT	0	+	43384863	44913631	0,0,0	Tau protein is a highly soluble microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). In humans, these proteins are found mostly in neurons compared to non-neuronal cells. One of tau's main functions is to modulate the stability of axonal microtubules. (...) The MAPT gene has two haplogroups, H1 and H2, in which the gene appears in inverted orientations. Haplogroup H2 is common only in Europe and in people with European ancestry. Haplogroup H1 appears to be associated with increased probability of certain dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease. The presence of both haplogroups in Europe means that recombination between inverted haplotypes can result in the lack of one of the functioning copies of the gene, resulting in congenital defects.

chrX_gl877877_fix	0	284527	PAR1-alt	0	+	0	284527	0,0,0	The pseudoautosomal regions, PAR1, PAR2 are homologous sequences of nucleotides on the X and Y chromosomes. They are hard-masked with Ns in some assembly sequence files, for example NCBI's analysis set of the genome and the files distributed by Ensembl. Wikipedia:(...) Normal male mammals have two copies of these genes: one in the pseudoautosomal region of their Y chromosome, the other in the corresponding portion of their X chromosome. Normal females also possess two copies of pseudoautosomal genes, as each of their two X chromosomes contains a pseudoautosomal region. Crossing over between the X and Y chromosomes is normally restricted to the pseudoautosomal regions; thus, pseudoautosomal genes exhibit an autosomal, rather than sex-linked, pattern of inheritance. So, females can inherit an allele originally present on the Y chromosome of their father. The function of these pseudoautosomal regions is that they allow the X and Y chromosomes to pair and properly segregate during meiosis in males.	This is an alternate region for PAR2 at chrY:10000-2649520. It is not annotated by NCBI or EBI as such.
